Vocial

Vocial means social volunteering and being vocal about THE cause.
It is a platform dedicated to connect people with the same interest:
making our Planet a better place, by volunteering. 
Non governmental organizations need physical and economical support and volunteers
want to participate at the right event for the cause they support;
that is exactly what Vocial provides.
